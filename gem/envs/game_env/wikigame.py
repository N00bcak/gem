    '''
    Implements a fully text-based Wikipedia Game environment.

    **WARNINGS**: 
    1. By default, this environment does NOT concatenate the 
    full history of observations and actions to the current observation.
    You can do so by wrapping this environment with the `ObservationWrapper`
    in `gem.wrappers.observation_wrapper`.
    2. This environment makes live API calls to Wikipedia.
        a. Excessive usage may get your IP address rate-limited or blocked by Wikimedia.
        b. The environment may be slow due to network latency.
        c. The environment may use a wide range of characters which may exceed some models' vocabularies.

    Environment Description:

    The Wikipedia Game is a fully observable, static, (almost) deterministic, single-agent environment
    where the agent's objective is to navigate from a starting Wikipedia page to a target Wikipedia page
    within a limited number of hyperlink visits (turns).

    State: (p_current, p_target, step_ct):
        - (p_current) The title and plain-text body of the current Wikipedia page, with the exception of hyperlinks,
            whose HTML tags are retained to identify neighboring pages.
        - (p_target) The title of the target Wikipedia page.
        - (step_ct) The current turn count, starting from 0.

    Initial State:
        - (p_current) A random Wikipedia page as the starting page
        - (p_target) A random Wikipedia page as the target page

    Action & Transition: 
        - The title of a neighboring Wikipedia page, specified within \\boxed{} tags.
        - p_current <- any Wikipedia page whose title matches that of the action.
        - If the action does not correspond to a valid neighboring page, p_current remains unchanged.
        - Regardless of the validity of the action, step_ct increments by 1.

    Terminal State:
        - The game **terminates** when the agent reaches the target page (p_current == p_target).
        - The game **truncates** when the agent exhausts the maximum number of allowed turns without reaching the target page
    
    Reward Function:
        - +1 if the agent reaches the target page (success)
        - -0.01 if the action was not parseable (format error)
        - 0 otherwise.

        Since the model's performance is being judged based on the number of steps taken to reach the target page,
        we help the model perform by making it clear that the model should use its general knowledge
        instead of inefficient backtracking or random exploration.

        Some preliminaries that guide prompting decisions:
        - Concise and least-ambiguous specification of the game
            - e.g. by defining terms like "page", "neighboring page"
        - Clear instructions on how to provide actions
            - e.g. by specifying the format of the action (in box tags)
        - Wikipedia Game is not a game where pure navigation skills can let you excel,
            but rather, general knowledge and familiarity with Wikipedia's structure is key.
